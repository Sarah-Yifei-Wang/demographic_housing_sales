## Finding meaning in the noise - Clusters, demographics, and changes in housing sales
### Our question: can we cluster demographic information to create  a meaningful model of year over year real estate sales?
1. Investigate changes in home sales during 2020
2. Real estate predictions
  i.Predict time on market for a zip code by demographics in that zip code
  ii. Predict Year over Year Percentage change in average sale price
  iii. Clustering demographics to predict trends (time series)
3. Use clustering of demographics to model sales trends
